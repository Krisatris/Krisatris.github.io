## pattern

### legs (make two)

start with yellow yarn

| round # | pattern            | total stitches |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| R1      | 5 sc in magic ring | 5              |
| R2      | 5 inc              | 10             |
| R3      | (1 sc, inc) x 5    | 15             |
| R4      | 15 sc              | 15             |

tie off **one leg**, but not the other. the other leg will be used to crochet the legs together.

### body

start by slip stitching the two legs together using the yarn from the leg that wasn't tied off. 
the round will be completed by making a circle around the outside of the legs.
i suggest watching the AmiSaigon video for a visual reference if needed.

> the white tummy can either be cross stitched on, or you can color swap on one of the 5 sc blocks in round 7 of the body (opposite from the round-starting stitch). the white block should decrease naturally as sc2tog's are done in white.

using brown yarn, embroider the nose onto the snout.

### assembly

i suggest following AmiSaigon's video for assembly as i ran out of time to get photos for this pattern (sorry ðŸ˜­)

1. sew head to body
   1. i suggest adding more stuffing to the neck here to keep the head from being floppy
2. sew arms to body pointing upwards rather than where the head meets the body
3. sew ears to the head slightly in front of center to leave space for the mane
4. sew the mane on starting with the middle spike on the top of the head. sew each spike on seperately using the tails.
5. sew the snout on in the middle of the face
6. using brown yarn, embroider the eyes onto the face next to the snout.

and you're done! 
feel free to tag me on twitter (_krisatris) or bluesky (krisatris.gay) with your final project!
i'd love to see them :3
