### loossemble forever

i've had an ongoing joke for a while that only three at most of my four favorite kpop groups are allowed to do well at any given time.
of those groups, pixy is currently (silently) disbanded, onlyoneof is in flux but at least got a season's greetings, ablume is gearing up to redebut, and loossemble just announced that they ended their contracts with their current label, who they had only been with for a year.
the loona girls are literally cursed. 
ive been following them since 2016 (around when haseul's let me in dropped), and i swear this industry is setup to make them fail, in particular.
i will maintain that this year alone has been the best year for loona music ever, but i am simultaneously so tired of this industry being the way it is, while also being so excited for whatever looble does next.
i trust those five girls more than anything to do whatever they think will be best for their careers. 
loossemble forever. 💛🧡💗💙🖤
